In this chapter, we review the structural and magnetic properties of bulk crystal, thin film and single MPcs molecules adsorbed on different substrates. Traditional magnetic measurements and new techniques like x-ray magnetic circular dichroism show that the magnetic behavior of MPc molecules is strongly related with the electronic ground state of the central metal atom hybridized with the ligand states (intra-molecular interaction). In bulk and thin films, with stacked molecules, intermolecular exchange interactions between magnetic M atoms regulates their magnetic properties. Moreover experimental results show that the magnetic properties of single molecules are strongly affected by the electronic coupling to the supporting substrate.},

Results using this model provide clear evidence that the first molecular layer of FePc contacting the sapphire substrate differs from the subsequent uniformly spaced molecular layers, indicating a Stranski-Krastanov growth mode. The {$\alpha$}-to-{$\beta$} structural phase transformation of FePc was observed as a function of substrate temperature. No significant effect of postdeposition in situ annealing time was observed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal a temperature-dependent morphology as the FePc changes from grains, to extended films, and finally shows crystallite formation for increasing deposition temperature. Structural characteristics obtained by SUPREX refinement and AFM quantitatively agree for surface roughness and average molecular layer spacing.},

Iron phthalocyanine thin films are grown on sapphire substrates at different temperatures to study the effect of grain growth kinematics and to experimentally quantify the grain size distribution in organic thin films. The grain size is measured with an atomic force microscope and the data is processed and analyzed with well-known image segmentation algorithms. For relevant statistics, over 3000 grains are evaluated for each sample. The data show pronounced asymmetric grain growth with increasing deposition temperature from almost spherical grains at room temperature to elongated needlelike shapes at 260 \textdegree{}C. The average size along the major axis increases from 35 to 200 nm and along the minor axis from 25 to 90 nm. The distribution is almost symmetric at low-deposition temperatures, but becomes lognormal at higher temperatures. Strikingly, the major axis and minor axis of the elliptically shaped grains have different distributions at all temperatures due to the planar asymmetry of the molecule.},

  abstract = {Previous magnetic studies in the organic semiconductor {$\beta$} -manganese phthalocyanine ( {$\beta$} -MnPc) have reported it to be a canted ferromagnet below T C {$\approx$} 8.6 K. However, the recent result of the lack of a {$\lambda$} -type anomaly in the specific heat versus temperature data near the quoted T C has questioned the presence of long-range 3-dimensional (3D) magnetic ordering in this system. In this paper, detailed measurements and analysis of the temperature (2 K\textendash{}300 K) and magnetic field (up to 90 kOe) dependence of the dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities in a powder sample of {$\beta$} -MnPc leads us to conclude that 3D long-range magnetic ordering is absent in this material. This is supported by the Arrott plots and the lack of a peak in the ac susceptibilities, {$\chi$} {${'}$} and {$\chi$} {${''}$}, near the quoted T C . Instead, the system can be best described as an Ising-like chain magnet with Arrhenius relaxation of the magnetization governed by an intra-layer ferromagnetic exchange constant J / k B = 2.6 K and the single ion anisotropy energy parameter | D |/ k B = 8.3 K.
